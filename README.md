# 2ECE-A_MUNSON_EXPERIMENT-4---DATA-WRANGLING-AND-DATA-VISUALIZATION

Experiment 4 requires us to be able to utilize data wrangling and data visualization codes. The experiment first requires downloading the file boards2.xlsx, which was converted to .csv prior to use.

## Problem 1
Problem 1 focuses on the use of data wrangling. There are two data frames that need to be created based on the given formats. The first data frame format is Filename: Instru = [“Name”, “GEAS”, “Electronics >70”]; where track is constant as Instrumentation and hometown Luzon. The second data frame format is Filename: Mindy = [ “Name”, “Track”, “Electronics”, “Average >=55”]; where hometown is constant as Mindanao and gender Female.
